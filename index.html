  <p>The Caribbean Digital conference (TCD) is headed to Kingston! TCD is excited to return to the Caribbean this year, bringing our community to the University of the West Indies, MONA campus. TCD is an annual international gathering held in locations throughout the Americas since 2014. Alternating between events organized via CFP and smaller events convened exclusively by invitation, TCD has created a singular and consistent space of exchange for Caribbeanist digital scholars, consisting of traditional panels, roundtable conversations, skills-building workshops, and project show-and-tells. The work done in preparation for this gathering and/or produced in its wake has led to the publication (in <a href="https://archipelagosjournal.org/" target="_blank"><em>archipelagos journal</em></a> alone) of more nearly 50 peer-reviewed scholarly articles, and inspired and contributed to many digital projects in Caribbean Studies. In addition, the conference has produced its own constellations of digital projects, including a collectively generated <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/1914/20151224034325/http://caribbeandigital.cdrs.columbia.edu/?page_id=113" target="_blank">bibliography</a>, a collective <a href="https://via.hypothes.is/https://cahier1939ms.github.io/texts/translation/" target="_blank">translation</a>, a <a href="https://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/" target="_blank">keywords</a> project, and a <a href="https://caribbeandigitalnyc.net/caridischo/" target="_blank">directory</a> of Caribbean digital scholarship.</p>
