      <strong>Gabrielle Mary Jean-Louis</strong>
      is a PhD student in the Department of English at the University of Miami.
      She specializes in contemporary Haitian women's literary and visual
      culture. Her research delves into the presentation of healing
      methodologies within intimate Black diasporic feminine spaces, exploring
      how diasporic communities provide Haitian female subjects with avenues for
      spiritual healing through interfaith dialogues, exposure to African
      spiritual practices, and Western psychotherapy.

      leadership and coordination in the planning and implementation of the
      Caribbean Digital Scholarship Collective grant. Andreína is a Doctoral
      candidate in History from UC Santa Barbara. Her research intersects Latin
      American history, African diaspora studies, and digital humanities to
      examine how people of African descent contested and reshaped institutions,
      norms, and imperial geographies during the early modern period. She is
      also part of <a href="https://en.neogranadina.org/">Neogranadina</a>, a
      digital humanities non-profit devoted to the preservation and promotion of
